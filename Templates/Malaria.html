  <h1>Malaria</h1>

<div class="container">
  <p><strong>Malaria</strong> is a disease caused by a parasite. The parasite is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. People who have malaria usually feel very sick, with a high fever and shaking chills. Each year, approximately 210 million people are infected with malaria, and about 440,000 people die from the disease. Most of the people who die from the disease are young children in Africa.</p>
  <p>While the disease is uncommon in temperate climates, malaria is still common in tropical and subtropical countries. World health officials are trying to reduce the incidence of malaria by distributing bed nets to help protect people from mosquito bites as they sleep. Scientists around the world are working to develop a vaccine to prevent malaria.</p>
  <p>If youâ€™re traveling to locations where malaria is common, take steps to prevent mosquito bites by wearing protective clothing, using insect repellants and sleeping under treated mosquito nets. Depending on the area you are visiting and your individual risk factors for infection, you may also want to take preventive medicine before, during and after your trip. Many malaria parasites are now resistant to the most common drugs used to treat the disease.</p>
  <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
  <p>To diagnose malaria, your doctor will likely review your medical history, conduct a physical exam and order blood tests. Blood tests are the only way to confirm a malaria diagnosis. Certain blood tests can help your doctor by showing:</p>
  <pre><code>1. The presence of the parasite in the blood, to confirm that you have malaria
2. Which type of malaria parasite is causing your symptoms
3. If your infection is caused by a parasite resistant to certain drugs</code></pre>
  <p>Other blood tests help determine whether the disease is causing any serious complications.</p>
  <p>Some blood tests can take several days to complete, while others can produce results in less than 15 minutes.</p>
  <h2>Treatment</h2>
  <p>Treatment aims to eliminate the Plasmodium
